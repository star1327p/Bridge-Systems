#### Non-forcing Stayman
2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Usually responder will have a decent 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).

Opener rebids:

   * 2♦: no four-card major
   * 2♥: four or five hearts and less than five spades
   * 2♠: five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades

Responder's rebids after 2♥ or 2♠:
   * 2♠ (over 2♥): four spades, denies four hearts
   * 3♠ (over 2♥) or 3♥ (over 2♠): forcing raise, slam interest, requests cue bid
   * 3 of that major: invitational
   * 4 of that major: signoff

Responder's rebids after any response:
   * 2NT: invitational, not necessarily with an unbid major
   * 3♣, 3♦: five cards, slam interest
   * 3NT: signoff with an unbid major (choice of games)
   * 4♣: Gerber (key card if over a major)
   * 4♦, 4♥ (over 2♠): unused
   * 4NT: quantitative
