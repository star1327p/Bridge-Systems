<p>2♣ is “non-forcing” Stayman, meaning that the bidding can stop in two of a suit (Garbage Stayman).
Usually responder will have 8+ HCPs (assuming a 15-17 1NT range).</p>

<p>Opener rebids:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>2♦: no four-card major</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2♥: four or five hearts and less than five spades</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2♠: five spades (possibly with four hearts) or four spades</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Responder will generally invite or bid game.
If responder rebids three of either minor,
he shows slam interest and at least a five-card suit.
A rebid of 4NT over a major is Blackwood so if you want to make a quantitative raise,
you must bid a minor first.</p>
