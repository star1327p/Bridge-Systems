   * 3♥, 3♠ = at least a six-card suit and slam interest (rare outside competition since transfers are typically used instead).
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).
