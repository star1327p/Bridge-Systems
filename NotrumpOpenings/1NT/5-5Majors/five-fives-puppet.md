#### 2-level:
A transfer at the 2-level is used with certain hands with the majors.
   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass: bust
   * 2♦(transfer) followed by 2♠: 6 hearts, slam try (request to cue bid)
   * 2♥(transfer) followed by 3♥: 6 spades, slam try (request to cue bid)

#### 3-level: 5-5 hands
The 3-level is used to show most 5-5 hands.

   * 3♦: 5-5 minors, game forcing
   * 3♥: 5-5 majors, invitational
   * 3♠: 5-5 majors, choice of games

#### 4-level
   * 4♣ = Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * A direct raise of 1NT to 4NT is natural and invites 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).
