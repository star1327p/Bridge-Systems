#### 3 Diamonds 5-5 Majors Game-forcing
When using the 4-way transfers, the 3♦ bid is normally idle.
Instead of the traditional (1NT - 2♥ - 2♠ - 3♥), 
3♦ is now used to show a game forcing hand with both majors. 
This ensures that opener is declarer.

The other uses stay the same:
   * Transfer to the weaker major and pass: bust
   * 1NT - 2♦; 2♥ - 2♠: invitational
   * 1NT - 3♦: game forcing, 5-5 in majors

Note: This treatment is a simplified version of [Richard Pavlicek's](http://rpbridge.net/7g66.htm).
