#### Basic Responses
   * 2NT: Invitational 8-9
   * 3♣, 3♦: Weak sign-off. Opener must pass unless game is likely opposite nothing more than Qxxxxx.
   * 3♥, 3♠: Game force, 5+. However, transfers (if available) are preferred.
   * 3NT: sign-off
   * 4♣: Gerber, asking for aces. (See Slam Bidding)
   * 4NT: natural, quantitative invite to 6NT. 4NT is slam invitational only because 4♣ is available as Gerber (to ask about aces).
