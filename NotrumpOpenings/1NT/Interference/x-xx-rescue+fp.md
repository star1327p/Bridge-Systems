#### When Opponents Double
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are "on." For example:

* 1NT — (Double) — 2♣: Stayman
* 1NT — (Double) — 2♦: transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and a long minor, redouble for SOS.

* 1NT — (Double) — Redouble: Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).

Otherwise pass.
