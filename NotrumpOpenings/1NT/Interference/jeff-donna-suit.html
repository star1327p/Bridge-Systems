<p>Cue bid of opponent&#8217;s natural suit: Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](<a href="http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html" class="bare">http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html</a>) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)</p>

I have a real fit with you.”</p>
