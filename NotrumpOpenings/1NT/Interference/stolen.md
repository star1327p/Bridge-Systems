#### Over Interference
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

* 1NT — (Double) — 2♣: Stayman
* 1NT — (Double) — 2♦: transfer to hearts
* 1NT — (Double) — Redouble: SOS (bad hand with weak minor)

All systems are on thru 2NT. 
Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 2-level is a Stolen bid.

* 1NT — (2♥) — double: transfer to spades
* 1NT — (2♥) — 2♠ or 2NT: same as without interference

Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 3-level or higher is for negative, promising at least one major.

Cue bid of opponent's natural suit = Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)

If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”

1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥ = Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts

Higher level suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.

   * 3♣, 3♦ = Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
   * 3♥, 3♠ = Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.
