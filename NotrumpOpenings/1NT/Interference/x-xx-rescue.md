#### When Opponents Double
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are "on." For example:

* 1NT — (Double) — 2♣: Stayman
* 1NT — (Double) — 2♦: transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and a long minor, redouble for SOS.

* 1NT — (Double) — Redouble: Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).

Otherwise pass and let opener reopen the bidding.

* 1NT — (Double) — pass - (pass): Forcing - opener must either bids a 5-card suit or redoubles. 
Responder passes the redouble with 7+ (possibly less) 
or bids a 4-card suit to attempt to scramble to safety.
