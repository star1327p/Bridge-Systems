<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♣: Stayman</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♦: transfer to hearts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1NT — (Double) — Redouble: SOS (bad hand with weak minor)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All systems are on thru 2NT.
Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 2-level is a Stolen bid.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>1NT — (2♥) — double: transfer to spades</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1NT — (2♥) — 2♠ or 2NT: same as without interference</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents at the 3-level or higher is for negative, promising at least one major.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cue bid of opponent&#8217;s natural suit: Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](<a href="http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html" class="bare">http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html</a>) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥: Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Higher level suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>3♣, 3♦: Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3♥, 3♠: Game force, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.</p>
</li>
</ul>
