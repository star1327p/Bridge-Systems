#### When Opponents Double
If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:

1NT — (Double) — 2♣ = Stayman

1NT — (Double) — 2♦ = transfer to hearts

With a bad hand and no 5-card suit, redouble to scramble to safety, looking for a 4-4 or 4-3 fit.

1NT — (Double) — Redouble = Rescue - weak with no five-card suit (opener bids a four-card suit, pass or correct).

Otherwise pass and let opener reopen the bidding.

1NT — (Double) — pass - (pass) = Forcing: opener either bids a 5-card suit or redoubles.
Responder passes the redouble with 7+ (possibly less)
or bids a 5-card minor.
