<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♣: Stayman</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♦: transfer to hearts</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an opponent bids over your 1NT opener, conventional responses like Stayman
and transfers are “off.” Bids are natural except for a cuebid, which can be used with
game forcing strength as a substitute for Stayman.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥: Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts</p>
