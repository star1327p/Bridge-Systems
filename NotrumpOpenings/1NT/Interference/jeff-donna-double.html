<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♣: Stayman</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♦: transfer to hearts</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a bad hand and no 5-card suit, redouble to scramble to safety, looking for a 4-4 or 4-3 fit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — Redouble: Rescue - weak with no five-card suit (opener bids a four-card suit, pass or correct).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Otherwise pass and let opener reopen the bidding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — pass - (pass): Forcing: opener either bids a 5-card suit or redoubles.
Responder passes the redouble with 7+ (possibly less)
or bids a 5-card minor.</p>
