<div class="paragraph">
<p>If an opponent doubles, all conventional responses are “on.” For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♣: Stayman</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — 2♦: transfer to hearts</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a bad hand and a weak minor, redouble for SOS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Double) — Redouble: Rescue - weak with a long minor (opener bids 2♣, pass or correct).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Double of any natural suit bid by the opponents is for penalty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jacoby Transfers are on over 2♣.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Double of an artificial 2♣: Stayman, does not imply invitational or better values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cue bid of opponent&#8217;s natural suit: Game force, Stayman. Note: if the interference is a waiting bid (such as Cappelletti 2♣), it may be pragmatic to pass and wait for the suit to be shown in case a penalty double is a possibility. (For more information see [here](<a href="http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html" class="bare">http://www.bridgebuff.com/cappsucks.html</a>) although the entire system indicated is more complex than what is presented here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the opponents intervene over a conventional response, bids carry the same
meaning as if there were no intervention. A bid says, “I’m bidding voluntarily, so
I have a real fit with you.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1NT — (Pass) — 2♦ — (Double) — 2♥: Real fit for hearts — pass with only two hearts</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suit bids have a different meaning if the opponents intervene.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>2♥, 2♠: To play, 5+.</p>

<li>
<p>3♣, 3♦: Invitational, 5+, denying a stopper if a suit was shown.</p>
