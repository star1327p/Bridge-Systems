#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor.

   * 2♠ = transfer to clubs
      * 2NT: preacceptance (good support)
      * 3♣: normal response
   * 2NT = transfer to diamonds
      * 3♣: preacceptance (good support)
      * 3♦: normal response

After the transfer, responder can bid again to show extra length or strength:
   * New suit: shortness, mild slam try
   * 3NT: balanced, mild slam try
   * Raise to 4: invitational
   * Raise to 5: sign-off

When using this treatment, responder bids 2♣ (Stayman) with any game invitational hand. 
A rebid of 2NT over a 2♦ or 2♠ response shows an invitational hand that may or may not have a four-card major.
