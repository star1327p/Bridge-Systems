#### Minor Suit Transfer Bids

Transfers are used to show hands with a long minor that are either a bust or slam invitational.

   * 2NT = transfer to clubs
   * 3♣ = transfer to diamonds

Opener accepts the transfer unless game is reachable opposite nothing more than Qxxxxx.

After the transfer, responder can bid again to show extra length or strength:
   * New suit: shortness, mild slam try
   * 3NT: balanced, mild slam try
   * Raise to 4: invitational
   * Raise to 5: sign-off

When using this treatment, responder bids 2♣ (Stayman) with any game invitational hand. 
A rebid of 2NT over a 2♦ or 2♠ response shows an invitational hand that may or may not have a four-card major.
