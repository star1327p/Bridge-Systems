#### Jacoby Transfer
The Jacoby Transfer shows a five-card major.
After a 1NT opening (or overcall if systems are on - see Defensive Bidding):
   * 2♦: transfer to hearts
   * 2♥: transfer to spades

Opener accepts the transfer, though he can jump to the three level
with 17 points and four-card support for responder’s major. For example:

1NT — 2♦

   * 2♥: normal acceptance of the transfer
   * 3♥: 17 points and four-card heart support

If, after the transfer is accepted, responder bids a new suit,
that is natural and game forcing.
Possible calls after the accepted transfer are:

1NT — 2♥; 2♠
   * Pass: content to play 2♠
   * 2NT: invitational with a five-card suit
      * Pass or 3♠: minimum
      * 3NT or 4♠: maximum
   * 3♣, 3♦: natural (4+), slam interest
   * 3NT: asking for a choice between 3NT and 4♠
   * 4NT: quantitative invitation to 6♠ or 6NT with a five-card suit
   * 5NT: pick a slam (6♠ or 6NT)
   * 6♠: to play

#### Single-suited Major Hands
The Texas Transfer shows a six-card major.
After a 1NT or 2NT opening or overcall (if systems are on):

   * 4♦: transfer to hearts
   * 4♥: transfer to spades

Opener must accept the transfer.

When used in conjunction with the Jacoby Transfer,
the Texas Transfer gives you a way to show a range of single-suited hands
while reducing the risk of unwanted interference from the opponents.
The following shows how they are used with strong NT (15-17) openings.

   * Bust (would pass a 1-bid): Jacoby, pass
   * Invitational with a six-card suit (would make a 1 over 1 bid): Jacoby, raise to 3; Opener rebids:
      * pass: minimum
      * 3NT (rare - usually requires three cards and a balanced hand) or 4M: maximum
   * Game signoff (weak 2 strength): Texas, pass
   * Slam invitation (opening strength): Two options:
      * Jacoby, raise to 4 in suit (balanced)
      * Jacoby, jump in another suit (splinter)
   * Slam (stronger-than-minimum opening): Two options:
      * Texas, 4NT (Blackwood) OR 
      * Jacoby, other major (requests cue bids)
   * Pick a Slam: Texas, 5NT

It is rare, but a direct bid of 4♠ or 6♠ is to play and is only used when your hand is not amenable to transferring (for example, an unprotected king).
