<p>Balanced hands have either 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2, or 5-3-3-2 distribution.
This includes five-card majors unless the major is especially strong.
The following semi-balanced hands may be treated as balanced:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>5-4-2-2 (unless the length is in both majors)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6-3-2-2 (unless the length is in a major)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5-4-3-1 or 4-4-4-1 (if the length is not in both majors, the singleton is Q or better, and rebid problems are likely)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bidding structure for balanced hands is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>12-14: Open 1 of a suit, rebid NT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15-17: Open 1NT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>18-19: Open 1♣, rebid 1NT or an artificial bid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20-21: Open 2NT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>22-24: Open 2♣, rebid NT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25-27: Open 3NT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>28+: Open 2♣, jump NT</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>When non-vulnerable, these point ranges drop by a point.
These point ranges are not exact;
hands are upgraded or downgraded due to texture.</p>
