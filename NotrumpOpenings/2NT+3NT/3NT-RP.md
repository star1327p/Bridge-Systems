#### 3NT Strong Preempt
3NT shows a strong preempt, generally no more than one outside trick but 
too strong for an immediate bid at the 4-level.
   * 4♣ = normal response, opener passes or corrects
   * 4♦ = 2 aces
   * 4♥, 4♠ = natural, non-forcing
   * 4NT = 3 aces

This approach was developed by Richard Pavlicek and is further described [here](http://rpbridge.net/7g74.htm).
