#### Two Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2 of a minor shows a limit raise
      * 2♣: 3 card support
      * 2♦: 4+ card support
	  * 3 of the major: 5+ card support, unbalanced (rare)
   * Opener clarifies strength with the rebid   
      * 2 of the major: sign-off
	  * 3 of the major: good hand, requests cue bid
	  * 4 of the major: sign-off
      * 2♦ over 2♣ or 2♥ over 2♦: full opener, game try
	  * 2♥ over 1♠-2♣: 4 hearts, game try or better
	  * 2♠ over 1♥-2♣: 4 spades, game try or better
