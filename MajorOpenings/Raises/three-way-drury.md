#### Three-Way Reverse Drury
In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall). 
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following: 
   * 2♣: 4 cards, mixed raise or better
      * 2♦: asking bid
          * sign-off at 2: mixed raise
	  * new suit: limit raise and values in that suit
   * 2♦: 3 card limit raise

   * after either 2♣ or 2♦:
      * 2 of original major: sign-off
      * 2 of other major: 4 cards, full opener, game try
      * 3 of a minor: full opener, values in that suit, game try
   * 2♥ (over 1♠): Standard American 2♥ (about 10HCP, 5 hearts)
   * jump new suit: Fit jump (4 of opener's major AND a good 4 card major or 5 card minor - the jump suit)
   * 3 of the major: 5+ card support, unbalanced (rare)
