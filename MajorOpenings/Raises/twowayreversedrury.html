<p>In third or fourth position, a 1♥ or 1♠ opening may be light (equivalent to an overcall).
To prevent the contract from getting too high, responder may bid the following:
* 2 of a minor shows a limit raise
<strong> 2♣: 3 card support
</strong> 2♦: 4+ card support
* 3 of the major: 5+ card support, unbalanced (rare)
* Opener clarifies strength with the rebid
<strong> 2 of the major: sign-off
* 3 of the major: good hand, requests cue bid
* 4 of the major: sign-off
</strong> 2♦ over 2♣ or 2♥ over 2♦: full opener, game try
* 2♥ over 1♠-2♣: 4 hearts, game try or better
* 2♠ over 1♥-2♣: 4 spades, game try or better</p>
