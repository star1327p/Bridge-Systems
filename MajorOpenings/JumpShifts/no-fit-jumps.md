#### No-fit Jumps
Unless otherwise specified, a jump shift shows a decent hand (usually 9-11 HCP) and good suit (usually 6+ cards) and no fit for opener (two small at most).

1♠
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: no-fit jump

To show a weaker hand, bid 1NT and attempt to sign off.

1♠ - 1NT; 2♦
   * 2♥, 3♣: sign-off
