#### Weak Jump Shift
A jump shift in the other major shows a weak hand (less than invitational values) and 6+ cards. Opener must pass without good support.

1♠
   * 3♥: weak

To show an invitational hand in the other major or a minor, bid 1NT and then jump or reverse.

1♠ — 1NT — 2♦
   * 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: invitational

With a weak hand and a minor, you must pass if you have a singleton or void in opener's suit.
With a doubleton, you can bid 1NT and pass, correct, or sign off in opener's suit.
