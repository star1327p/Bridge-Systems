<p>To be biddable, a major suit must be as good as or better than one of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Six cards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kxxxx with shortness (singleton or void)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KQxxx with no shortness</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AQJx with a doubleton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AQxx with shortness</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
Opening bids are lighter than in standard methods.
In general if you would overcall in SAYC then you can open here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the opener could be light (as good as an overcall),
but it should have 3-card support in the other major
to avoid rebid problems.</p>
