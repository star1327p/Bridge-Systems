To be biddable, a major suit must be as good as or better than one of the following:
   * Six cards
   * Kxxxx with shortness (singleton or void)
   * KQxxx with no shortness
   * AQJx with a doubleton
   * AQxx with shortness

Open the higher of long suits of equal length: 5–5 or 6–6.
Opening bids are lighter than in standard methods. 
In general if you would overcall in SAYC then you can open here.

Note that the opener could be light (as good as an overcall),
but it should have 3-card support in the other major 
to avoid rebid problems.
