### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double, bid as naturally as possible.

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 1NT = non-forcing, 6-9 points, no four-card major or four-card support
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, could have good support.
   * 2♦ = weak, four-card trump support but fewer than 10 points.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.
