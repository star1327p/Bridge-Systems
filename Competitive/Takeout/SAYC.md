### Vs. Takeout Doubles
If RHO makes a takeout double:

1♦ — (Double)
   * 1♥, 1♠ = forcing, point count not limited.
   * 2♣ = non-forcing (6–10 points, usually a six-card suit).
   * 2NT = limit raise (at least 10 points) — or better.
   * Redouble = 10 points or more, but it is better to make a more
descriptive bid of 1♥, 1♠, or 2NT with the appropriate hand.
   * 3♦ = preemptive, good trump support but fewer than 10 points.

A responder’s jump shift after a double is to play:

1♦ — (Double) — 2♥, 2♠, 3♣ = six-plus card suit, like a weak two-bid or
preemptive three-bid.
