There is almost an endless variety of possible sequences, so it pays to have simple
guidelines to prevent bidding misunderstandings.

It is sometimes necessary to pick a bid that would normally have been a second choice
without the overcall:

1♦ — (Pass) — 1♠ — (2♣)

2♠ with ♠943 ♥A875 ♦AQJ4 ♣Q3 (rebid 1NT if RHO has passed)

### New Suits
In a competitive sequence, new suits are non-forcing but constructive 
(generally showing about 10-12 points).

Jump shifts are strong and forcing.
