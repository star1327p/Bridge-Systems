<p>The negative double is used through 4♦ promising four cards (at least) in an unbid major.
Bidding a major in competition shows a five-card or longer suit and strength suitable to the level.
With insufficient high-card strength for a free bid, double may also be used with a five-card or longer suit.</p>
