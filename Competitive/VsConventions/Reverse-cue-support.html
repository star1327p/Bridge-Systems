<div class="paragraph">
<p>After partner opens in a suit and a conventional bid by the opponents shows one known suit,
a cue bid shows a good raise, a double shows a good hand without support, and other bids are weak.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1♠ — (2♠:Michaels)</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>3♣, 3♦, 3♠: weak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3♥: Limit raise or better in spades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the conventional bid shows two known suits,
there are two cue bids available, the first shows the fourth suit and the second shows good support.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>1♣ — (2NT:Unusual)</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>3♣, 3♠: weak</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3♦: 10+HCP, 5+ spades</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3♥: Limit raise or better in clubs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Double: at least 10 points, possibly willing to make a penalty double.</p>
</li>
</ul>
