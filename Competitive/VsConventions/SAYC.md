### Against Conventions
If the opponents use a convention (such as Michaels or the unusual notrump), you
can double to show at least 10 HCP, or you can cuebid one of their shown suits
to force to game.
1♠ — (2♠) 
   * 3♥: game force.
   * Double: at least 10 HCP, possibly willing to make a penalty double.
