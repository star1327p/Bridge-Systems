### Cue Bids
Cuebidding right-hand opponent’s suit shows a limit raise or better:

1♠ — (2♣) — 3♣ = limit raise or better.

Note: If playing inverted minors ON in competition, then that treatment supercedes this one.

### Jump Raise
When using this treatment, a jump raise is weak / competitive.

1♠ - (2♣) - 3♠ = weak, 4+ card support

Note: if you pass a suit bid and bid it later, it is natural, not a cue bid:
   * (1♦) - p - (1♥) - p - (1♠) - 2♦ = natural, 6+
