### Reverses (with Lebensohl)
After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows a good 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit. 
(HCP strength can be lowered in cases of extreme distribution.)
Bidding 2NT is the only weak response. It is a relay to 3â™£ (pass or correct). In cases of extreme strength and/or distribution, Opener may bypass the relay.

All other bids by responder are natural and forcing to game. 
A rebid of a major shows a decent 5+ card suit.
