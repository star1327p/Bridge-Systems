<p>After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows a good 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit.
(HCP strength can be lowered in cases of extreme distribution.)
It is forcing and game-forcing unless Responder bids one step higher.
In that case Opener will retreat to the first suit unless the distribution is particularly freaky.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All other bids by Responder are natural and forcing to game.
A rebid of the first suit shows a decent 5+ cards.</p>
