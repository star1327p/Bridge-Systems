<div class="paragraph">
<p>After a 1/1 bid, a reverse shows 15+ HCP, an unbalanced hand, and at least five cards in the first suit.
It is forcing for one round.
Responder has two weak responses:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A rebid at the two-level shows 5+ cards in the suit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2NT denies 5+ cards</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these responses are forcing for one round.
Without good support, opener will usually retreat to the first suit.
The exception is when there is another unbid four-card suit (e.g., 5-0-4-4 distribution).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All other bids by responder are natural and forcing to game.</p>
