### Jump to Game
After a 1-level bid and any response by partner:
* a direct jump to game in opener's suit shows a one-suited hand 
that is too strong to preempt and too weak to jump rebid, reverse, or jump-shift.
Responder is expected to pass without support and/or excellent controls.
* a direct jump to game in responder's suit shows a strong balanced hand 
(18-19 HCP), 
generally with 4-card support and a side doubleton or stiff honor.
Responder is expected to continue with a limit hand or better.
