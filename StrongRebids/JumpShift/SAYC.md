### Opener Jump Shift
After a 1/1 or 1NT/1 bid, a jump shift shows 19+ total points and an unbalanced hand. 
Usually it shows 5+ cards in the first suit and 4+ in the second suit, 
although it can also show 6-3-3-1 or 4-4-4-1 distribution if the second suit is a minor.
It is forcing to game. 

Responses:
* A rebid at the two-level: 5+ cards in the suit
* 3NT: denies support, extra length, or shape
* new suit: natural, extras, often a first round control
* support of either suit below game: sets trumps and shows extra shape; responder rebids:
   * Suit: first round control
   * Exception: return to first suit (major only): 6-3-3-1 distribution (warning responder from a 4-3 fit)
   * Jump new suit: splinter
* game in either suit: signoff
