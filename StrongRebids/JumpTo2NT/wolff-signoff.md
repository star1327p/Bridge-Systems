### Opener 2NT Rebid
When opener's rebid (jump or otherwise) shows a stronger-than-1NT opening (17 or 18-19 HCP),
the following structure applies:

#### 1♦ - 1M; 2NT (similar structure for other combinations)

   * pass: weak hand, 4-card suit
   * 3♣: relay - opener must bid 3♦ 
      * pass, 3♥, 3♠: to play
      * 3NT: slam interest with secondary support in opener's suit
   * 3♦: artificial checkback for unbid major or secondary support (up the line)
   * 3♥, 3♠: Natural, GF
   * 3NT/4NT/5NT/6NT: natural (signoff/quantitative/pick-a-slam/signoff)
   * 4♣: Gerber
   * 4♦, 4♥: Transfer (if logical)
   * raise to 4: 6+ cards, signoff
