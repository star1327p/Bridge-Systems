### Jump Rebid
After an opening at the 1-level and nearly any response by partner, a jump rebid shows at least 16 total points and a good six card suit.
The suit should be strong enough to play opposite a small singleton. Responses:
* pass: bad fit, bad hand
* 3NT or raise to game: to play
* Other suit: cue bid in support of opener's suit
* 4NT: Blackwood (see [Slam Bidding](#slam-bidding))
