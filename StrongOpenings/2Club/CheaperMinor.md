A 2♣ opening shows at least 22+ points balanced, 8 1/2+ tricks in a major, or 9 1/2+ tricks in a minor.

Responses:

2♣:
   * 2♦: conventional, could be “waiting” with a good hand not suited to a
positive response
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural and game forcing with a minimum of 8 HCP and
a five-card suit with two of the top three honors
   * 2NT: 8+ HCP, balanced (systems off)

After a 2♦ response, opener rebids naturally:
   * 2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦: natural, forcing to 3 of opener’s
major or 4 of opener’s minor
   * 2NT: 22-23 points (see responses for 2NT opening above)
   * 3NT: 24-25 points (see responses for 3NT opening above)
   * 4NT: 28+ points

In response to a suit rebid, responder indicates strength.

2♣ — 2♦; 2♥:
   * 2♠, 3♦: natural, game force
   * 3♣: artificial (cheaper minor), very weak (0-4, not an ace)
   * 3NT: 5-7 points, balanced
   * 3♥: positive support, requests cue bid sequence
   * 4♥: fair support, discouraging slam

2♣ — 2♦; 3♦:
   * 3♥: "cheaper minor" (instead of 4♣)
   * others: same as above
