#### Fourth Suit Forcing
When the fourth suit is bid by either player (usually responder), it is artificial and forcing to game. 
Partner responds with the cheapest acceptable natural bid (unshown 4-card major, 3-card support, etc.).
Fourth suit bidder then clarifies the hand by bidding naturally.

The exception to this rule is when all four suits are bid at the 1-level. 
This is forcing for one round and does not guarantee spades.
