If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

#### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

Example: 1♦-1♠;2♣:
   * Pass
   * 2♦: 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠: 6+ spades

There is one exception to the rule that new suits are forcing: 1♦—1♠;1NT:
   * 2♥: sign-off - opener must pass or correct (bust with 5-4 or better distribution)
   
#### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, jump in a bid suit, new minor:

Example: 1♦-1♠;2♣:
   * 2NT, 3♣, 3♦, 3♠: 11–12 points, inviting game.

#### Forcing to Game
Bids available for forcing to game:
   * Fourth suit
   * Jump or reverse in new suit
   * New Minor Forcing followed by a rebid of previously bid suit
      * For example, 1♣-1♠;1NT-2♦;2♥-2♠ shows a game-forcing hand and a 6-card suit

Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see [Slam Bidding](#slam-bidding)) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.
