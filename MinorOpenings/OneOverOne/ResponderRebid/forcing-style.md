If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

#### Sign-off
Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

Example: 1♥-1♠;2♣:
   * Pass
   * 2♥: 2-3 hearts, likely misfit
   * 2♠: Usually 6+ spades

There is one exception to the rule that new suits are forcing: 1♣-1♠;1NT:
   * 2♥: sign-off - opener must pass or correct (bust with 5-5 or 5-4 distribution)
   
#### Inviting Game
Bids available for inviting game: 2NT(non-jump), new minor, fourth suit:

Example: 1♥-1♠;2♣:
   * 2♦, 2NT: 11–12 points, inviting game.

#### Forcing to Game
All second round jumps (including to 2NT) are forcing to 3NT or higher.
Opener can sign off in game or make a slam try. 
4NT is Blackwood (see topic) only if suit agreement has been established. 
Otherwise it is quantitative, asking responder to proceed with a maximum. 
Suit bids usually show controls.
