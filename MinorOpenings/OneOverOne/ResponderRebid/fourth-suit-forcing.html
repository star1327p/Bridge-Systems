<h4 id="fourth-suit-forcing">Fourth Suit Forcing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the fourth suit is bid by either player (usually responder), it is artificial and forcing to game.
Partner responds with the cheapest acceptable natural bid (unshown 4-card major, 3-card support, etc.).
Fourth suit bidder then clarifies the hand by bidding naturally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The exception to this rule is when all four suits are bid at the 1-level.
This is forcing for one round and does not guarantee spades.</p>
