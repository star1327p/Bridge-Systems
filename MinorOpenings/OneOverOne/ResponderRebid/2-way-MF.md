#### Two-Way Minor Forcing
After any three bids at the one level, 
bids of 2 of a minor and 2NT are artificial and forcing.

* 2♣: Forces relay to 2♦; Continuations:
   * pass: wanted to play 2♦

   * other major: invitational with 4 (if ♠) or 4+ (if ♥)
   * 2NT: invitational, balanced
   * 3m: invitational, natural
   * 3M (rebid): invitational, good six-card suit
   * 3♥ over 1♠: invitational, at least 6-5
* 2♦: Artificial game force; Opener responds with the cheapest acceptable natural bid (unshown 4-card major, 3-card support, etc.); Continuations:
   * 2♠ over 2♥: denies interest in hearts 4-4 in the majors
