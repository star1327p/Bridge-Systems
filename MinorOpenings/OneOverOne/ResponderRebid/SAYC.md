If responder has bid a suit at the one level, he next determines whether he wishes
to sign off in a partscore, invite game, sign off in game, or force to game and get
more information about opener’s hand.

Bids available for a sign-off in partscore: Pass, 1NT, 2 of a previously bid suit.

1♦ — 1♠

2♣ — Pass, 2♥, 2♠ = 6–10 points, sign-off in partscore.

Bids available for inviting game: 2NT, 3 of a previously bid suit:

1♦ — 1♠

2♣ — 2NT, 3♦, 3♥, 3♠ = 11–12 points, inviting game.

After opener rebids in a suit, a new suit by responder is forcing. If the new suit is the
fourth suit, the bid may be artificial/conventional.

1♦ — 1♠

2♣ — 2♦ = one-round force, could be conventional.

However, after a 1NT rebid by opener, bids of a new suit at the next higher level are
non-forcing.

1♦ — 1♠

1NT — 2♣, 2♦ = non-forcing. Responder must jump shift to 3♣ or 3♦ to force game.
Second-round forcing bids following a 1NT rebid by opener: a reverse or jump shift
into a new suit is a game force.

1♣ — 1♥

1NT — 2♠ or 3♦ = game force.

Bids available for signing off in game.

3NT, 4♥, 4♠, 5♣, 5♦.

If responder initially bids a new suit at the two level, the same rules apply EXCEPT
that a subsequent jump raise of opener’s first suit to the THREE LEVEL is game
forcing — responder should make a limit raise directly over the opening with 10–12
points and at least three-card support:

1♠ — 2♣

2♥ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♥ = Invitation to game (11–12 points).

— 2♠ = preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a
 doubleton spade.

 — 3♦ = game force, could be conventional.

 — 3♠ = game force.

NOTE: Responder promises to bid again if he responded with a new suit at the two
level unless opener’s rebid is at the game level.

1♠ — 2♣

2♦ = forcing one round. Responder can limit his hand by bidding 2♠, 2NT, 3♣,
or 3♦ at this point. He should not pass, since opener could have 18
points (just short of a jump shift rebid).
