or a sub-minimum with 4-card support
   * 1NT: balanced with 2 or 3-card support for partner, 
or unbalanced with a stiff A or K in partner's suit and no other alternative
   * rebid suit: 6-cards or strong 5
   * new suit (non-reverse): 4-cards
   * raise to 2: minimum, usually 4-cards
   * jump raise: invitational, 17-18 dummy points
   * 3NT: to play, usually long running minor
   * jump to game: 19+ dummy points, 4-card support
