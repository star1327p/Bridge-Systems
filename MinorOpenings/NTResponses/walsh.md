#### 1NT
1NT over 1♣: balanced 8–10 HCP, no four-card major. (With 6-8 HCP, bid 1♦ instead so that opener can declare 1NT if possible.)
Over 1♦ the range is wider (6-10 HCP).
It is not forcing, but opener is expected to bid with a strong and/or unbalanced hand.

#### 2NT
2NT: invitational balanced hand (11-12 HCP), no four-card major.

#### 3NT
3NT: game-value balanced hand (13-15 HCP), no four-card major.

#### 4NT
4NT: quantitative balanced hand (16-18 HCP), no four-card major.
