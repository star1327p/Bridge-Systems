<p>﻿A 1♦ opener suggests a four-card or longer suit, since 1♣ is preferred on hands
where a three-card minor suit must be opened.
The exception is a hand with 4=4=3=2 shape which should be opened 1♦.
With 9+ cards in the minors, generally open the longer minor first.
If the minor is clubs, make sure you have a suitable rebid after partner&#8217;s response.</p>
