<p>Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major.
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.
Raises are inverted so a raise to two is strong (limit raise or better)
and a raise to 3 is weak (preemptive). When vulnerable, a jump raise should be
sound (8-9 dummy points) but when non-vulnerable it is much more wide-ranging.</p>
