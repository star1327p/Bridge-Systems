<p>﻿Responder needs more trumps to raise (four to raise 1♦; five to raise 1♣,
though one fewer trump will do in a pinch in a competitive sequence).
Since four card majors should be bid up-the-line, a raise denies a four card major.
Once a minor is raised, the bidding must end in that suit or NT.</p>
