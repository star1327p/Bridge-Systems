## 1♣ Opening
A 1♣ opening shows 4+ clubs and an unbalanced 13-19 DP or 2+ clubs and a balanced 16-18 DP.

### 1♦ Response
A 1♦ response is artificial and forcing.
It is the default response if no other response applies and there is no desire to play 1♣. 
It asks opener to further describe the hand.
All rebids by opener are nonforcing and natural:
   * 1♥ or 1♠: an unbalanced 13-17 DP and 4 of that major. (If both majors are held, bid 1♠ and show hearts later if needed.)
   * 1NT: a balanced 16-18 DP. (See below for continuations)
   * 2♣: an unbalanced 13-17 DP and 6+ cards in the suit.
   * 2♦, 2♥, or 2♠: a maximum (18-19 DP) unbalanced hand with 4 cards in the suit. 
   * 3♣: a maximum (18-19 DP) and 6+ cards in the suit. 

#### 1NT Rebid
After a 1NT rebid, the following responses apply:
   * 2♦: Natural (weak 2 strength)
   * 2♥/2♠: Weak, 5 of that major and 4 of the other major
   * All others: same as 1NT opening but adjusted for higher strength

### 1♥ or 1♠ Response
A response in a major shows 5+ cards and is forcing.
   * Lowest unbid suit: artificial, unbalanced, denies support
   * One step below a single raise: a maximum raise
   * 1NT: a balanced 16-18 DP without good support
   * Single raise: minimal support
   * 2♣ or 3♣: see above

### 1NT Response
This shows a balanced hand with 9-12 DP and no four-card major.
This is forcing. With a balanced hand, opener treats it as invitational and bids 2NT or 3NT.
With an unbalanced hand, opener bids the second suit with a minimum or shows shortness at the 3-level with a maximum.

### 2♣ Response
This shows good support (11+ DP and usually 5+ cards) and no four-card major.
This is forcing. With a balanced hand, opener bids 3NT. 
Otherwise stoppers are bid up the line until a safe NT contract is reached or someone retreats to clubs.

### Suit responses of 2♦ or higher
These bids are weak (less than a normal weak 2 or preempt) and natural. 
Opener is expected to pass without good support.

### 2NT Response
This shows a balanced hand of opening strength.
Opener raises with a balanced hand and rebids a short suit with an unbalanced hand.

### 3♣ Response
This shows a weak hand (10 or fewer DP and usually 5+ cards) and no four-card major.
Opener will usually pass but in rare circumstances will raise or bid 3NT.

## 2♦ Opening
A 2♦ opening shows 5+ diamonds and an unbalanced 13-19 DP or a balanced 16-18 DP.

### 2♥ or 2♠ Response
These bids are forcing and promise 9+ DP with diamond tolerance or 11+ without.
Opener will support with four-card support, bid 2NT if balanced, or bid another suit to show a stopper.

### 2NT Response
Shows 11+ DP with stoppers in unbid suits (particularly majors). It is forcing. 
Opener rebids are as follows:
   * 3♦: minimum
   * 3 of another suit: shortness, non-minimum
   * 3NT: balanced
   
### Direct Raises
Direct raises to any level are weak and preemptive.
