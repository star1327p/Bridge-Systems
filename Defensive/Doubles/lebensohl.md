### Lebensohl over a Weak-Two
After a Weak-Two by the opponents followed by a Takeout Double and 
a pass by responder, 2NT is a conventional response, requesting (but not insisting) on a relay to 3♣. This allows Advancer to distinguish between minimum, intermediate, and maximum hands.

(2♠)X(p):
* 2NT: Relay to 3♣
   * pass, 3♦, 3♥: to play (7 or fewer HCP)
   * 3♠: 4 hearts, spade stopper, GF
   * 3NT: to play, no heart suit, stopper
   * _The 3♣ Relay may be bypassed with 22+ HCP or 9+ playing tricks_
* 3♣, 3♦, 3♥: semi-positive (8-11 HCP)
* 3♠: game values, 4 hearts, no stopper
* 3NT: game values, no heart suit, no stopper
