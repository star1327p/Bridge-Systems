### Responsive Doubles
After an opponent bids at the one level, partner doubles for takeout,
and the other opponent raises, a double by advancer is responsive. 
This allows the original doubler to be declarer and to pick the preferred suit.

Responsive Doubles are on through 4â™¦ but off after a preemptive opening.
