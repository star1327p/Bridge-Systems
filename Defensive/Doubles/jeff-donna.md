### Doubles
A double is for takeout over a partscore bid (4♦ or lower). 
In the direct position over a 1-level bid, it shows support for the unbid suits and 
enough strength to warrant getting into the auction 
(usually 10+ points with shortness in opener's suit OR 18+ points and any distribution). 
In the balancing position it can be 2-3 points lighter.

Advancer is expected to bid after a takeout double. 
The Rule of 9 (#cards + #honors + bid level >= 9) is a reasonable guideline to determine when to convert the double to penalty.
With insufficient strength and no compelling suit, a 1NT bid is permissible. 
If you have two places to play, look for a way to show both suits:
* Spades and a minor: bid the minor first
* Hearts and a minor: bid hearts first
* Both majors or both minors: bid the higher suit first

A below-game jump response to a takeout double is invitational (9-12 declarer points). 
To force for one round, responder cuebids opener’s suit. 
This is forcing to game by an unpassed hand.

Any subsequent bid by doubler shows significant extras and is strongly invitational to game. 
If advancer has jumped, then a new suit or NT bid by doubler is forcing to game.

#### After a Game Bid
Over 4♥, a double is penalty-oriented, usually with spade tolerance. Advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values. 4NT (either directly or after a double) shows the minors.

After 4♠, a double is penalty-oriented. Advancer may pull the double with undisclosed distribution and/or poor defensive values. 4NT (either directly or after a double) is for takeout, showing at least two places to play.

#### Balancing
When the opponents have shown a major fit, balancing is very aggressive especially when non-vulnerable. 

* (1♠)-p-(2♠)-p;(p)X: takeout
* (1♠)-p-(2♠)-p;(p)2NT: minors
