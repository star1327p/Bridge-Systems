### Suit Overcalls
Suit overcalls show 8–16 points (double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand). 
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid, 
but it may be made with about a king less.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural. 

The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:

(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦
   * (Pass) — 2♠: minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other: extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).

Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:

(1♦)
   * 2♠: a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.
   * 3♣: a hand that would open 3♣.

A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid two suits is natural in the second suit but Michaels in the first suit.

#### vs. Opening Preempt
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural. 
* Two-level: any opening hand with a five-card suit
* Three-level: extras: 15+ total points
* Four-level: significant extras: 17+ total points
* Jump raise over a Weak-Two: significant extras, but non-forcing
(with a Strong-Two hand, double first then jump to game.)
* Jump overcall to game is to play and is semi-preemptive
* _In the balancing seat, an overcall can be a king lighter_

#### Responses
Raises are natural and generally preemptive.
A new suit is non-forcing but constructive.

A cuebid of opener’s suit by an unpassed hand shows any good hand and is forcing for one round. Advancer will return to Overcaller's suit to show a limit raise or better.
A cuebid of opener's suit by a passed hand shows good support (limit raise or better).

Examples:
(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦:
   * (Pass) — 2♠: minimum overcall.
   * (Pass) — other: natural, game-forcing.
