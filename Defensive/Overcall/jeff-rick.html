<h3 id="suit-overcalls">Suit Overcalls</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suit overcalls show 8–16 points (double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand).
A reopening bid means much the same as a direct seat bid,
but it may be made with about a king less.
Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only forcing response is a cuebid of opener’s suit, asking the overcaller about
the quality of his overcall:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Pass) — 2♠: minimum overcall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Pass) — other: extra strength (11 or 12 points minimum).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(1♦):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>2♠: a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3♣: a hand that would open 3♣.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cuebid overcall when the opponents have bid two suits is natural in the second suit but Michaels in the first suit.</p>

<p>Versus an opening preempt, an overcall is natural.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Two-level: any opening hand with a five-card suit</p>

<li>
<p>Three-level: extras: 15+ total points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four-level: significant extras: 17+ total points</p>

<li>
<p>Jump raise over a Weak-Two: significant extras, but non-forcing
(with a Strong-Two hand, double first then jump to game.)</p>

<p>Jump overcall to game is to play and is semi-preemptive</p>

<p>Raises are natural and generally preemptive.
A new suit is non-forcing but constructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cuebid of opener’s suit by an unpassed hand shows any good hand and is forcing for one round. Advancer will return to Overcaller&#8217;s suit to show a limit raise or better.
A cuebid of opener&#8217;s suit by a passed hand shows good support (limit raise or better).</p>

<p>Examples:
(1♦) — 1♠ — (Pass) — 2♦:
 * (Pass) — 2♠: minimum overcall.
 * (Pass) — other: natural, game-forcing.</p>
