<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suit overcalls show 7–16 points nonvulnerable and 9-16 points vulnerable
(double and bid the long suit with a stronger hand).
In general an overcall shows 5+ cards
but it may show a strong 4 (AKJx) at the one level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jump overcalls are preemptive, showing the same value as an opening bid at the
same level:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>2♠: a hand that would open a weak two-bid in spades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3♣: a hand that would open 3♣.</p>

</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A balancing bid means much the same as a direct seat bid,
but it may be made with about a king less.</p>

<p>When the opponents have bid two suits,
an overcall in either suit is natural.</p>

<p>The one exception to overcalls is over 1♣ where an overcall of 1♦ does little to obstruct the opponents.

<ul>
<li>
<p>1♦: a good 4, a light overcall with 5, weak 2 (Vul only), or a maximum overcall (will bid again if possible)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Two-level: any opening hand with a five-card suit</p>

<li>
<p>Four-level: significant extras: 17+ total points</p>

<li>
<p>Jump raise over a Weak-Two: significant extras, but non-forcing
(with a Strong-Two hand, double first then jump to game.)</p>

<p>Jump overcall to game is to play and is semi-preemptive</p>

<p>Raises are natural and generally preemptive.
A new suit is non-forcing but constructive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cuebid of opener’s suit by an unpassed hand shows any good hand and is forcing for one round. Advancer will return to Overcaller&#8217;s suit to show a limit raise or better.
A cuebid of opener&#8217;s suit by a passed hand shows good support (limit raise or better).</p>
