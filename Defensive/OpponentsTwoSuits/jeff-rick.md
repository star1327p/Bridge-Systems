### After Opponents Bid Two Suits
After the opponents show two suits, it is often prudent to show the other two suits.

* Double: 4+ cards in each unbid suit and/or extra strength
* Cheapest unbid suit: Standard overcall; Continuations by overcaller:
   * Pass: Minimum
   * Fourth suit (if first suit is not supported): Opening strength, two-suited
   * Fourth suit (if first suit is supported): More than opening strength, game try
* Lower bid suit: Michaels (5-5 distribution expected)
* Higher bid suit: Natural
* 2NT: 5-5 or more in the two unbid suits, preemptive
