### After Opponents Bid Two Suits
After the opponents show two suits, it is often prudent to show the other two suits.

* Double: 9 cards in the unbid suits and/or extra strength
* Cheapest unbid suit: Standard overcall; Continuations by overcaller:
   * Pass: Minimum
   * Fourth suit (if first suit is not supported): Opening strength, two-suited
   * Fourth suit (if first suit is supported): More than opening strength, game try
* 2NT: 5-5 in the two unbid suits, less than opening strength
   * Overcaller will pass any response without extra length
