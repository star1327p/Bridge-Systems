<div class="paragraph">
<p>A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lower two unbid suits.
(It may show 4-5-2-2 distribution but in that case it should be a king stronger.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(1♦) - 2NT: hearts and clubs</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional.
(Any subsequent bid by the cuebidder shows extra strength or distribution.)
With an normal opening hand it is better to bid the higher suit then rebid the lower suit if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note: Unusual 2NT may be off in the reopening seat (see NT Overcalls above).</p>
