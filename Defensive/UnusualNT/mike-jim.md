### Unusual 2NT
A jump overcall of 2NT shows at least 5–5 in the lowest suit and a higher suit. 
The strength is either weak or very strong/distributional. 

(1♦) - 2NT: clubs and either hearts or spades

Advancer will usually either bid the lowest suit (showing tolerance) 
or the next step up (asking Overcaller to show the second suit).

Higher advances are possible: 
* An unbid suit shows extra length
* A cue bid or jump shows extra strength
* 3NT is to play

### Unusual 4NT
In a highly competitive auction, 4NT is also unusual.

Over an opening 4♠ bid, 4NT is takeout.
