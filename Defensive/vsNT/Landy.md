### Landy vs 1NT
#### Unpassed Hand
Landy is a simple defense to 1NT with only one artificial bid:
   * Double: Penalty
   * 2♣: Majors (5-5 when vulnerable, may be shorter when non-vulnerable)
   * 2NT: Minors
   * Others: Natural

After 2♣, advancer generally bids the better major.
   * pass: No major, long clubs
   * 2♦: No preference
   * 2♥, 2♠: Weak, sign-off
   * 2NT: Forcing, invitational in either major
   * 3♥, 3♠: Limit raise
   * 4♥, 4♠: To play

#### Passed Hand
Since it is impossible to have a penalty double as a passed hand,
double is a relay to 2♣.
