## Preemptive Bids
Opening suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and 
may be very weak particularly in first or third seat. 
In a major they typically show seven cards. 
In a minor (particularly clubs) the rules are less strict especially in Matchpoints and/or non-vulnerable. 
   
Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:
   * more than one outside trick
   * a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better
   * a void in a minor

Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.

Raises are best used with an unbalanced hand and decent trump support.
