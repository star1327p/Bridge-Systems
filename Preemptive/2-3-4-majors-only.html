<p>Opening major suit bids at the three level and higher are preemptive and based on playing tricks
(the number of tricks you expect to take if your long suit is trumps).
Overbid based on the rule of 2-3-4:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>vulnerable vs. nonvulnerable: overbid by 2 tricks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>equal vulnerability: overbid by 3 tricks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nonvulnerable vs. vulnerable: overbid by 4 tricks</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a minor, preempts are less predictable so be cautious about raising
with a balanced hand.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Preempts are generally not made in first or second position with:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>more than one outside trick</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a four-card major Q-x-x-x or better</p>

<li>
<p>a void in a minor</p>

<p>Responses in new suits or NT are natural and forcing if below game.</p>
