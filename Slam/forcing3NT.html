<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once agreement in a major suit has been reached,
a bid of 3NT is a slam try that asks responder to cue bid first-round controls.
A voluntary cue bid at the 4-level that skips 3NT is also a slam try.
The two bids say nothing specific about hand strength
but are more tactical in nature.
For example, the player that will be declarer may choose to bid 3NT
so as to not reveal any unnecessary information about the closed hand.</p>
