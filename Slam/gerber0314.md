### Gerber
4♣ is Gerber over any 1NT OR 2NT by partner, including a rebid of
1NT OR 2NT. Responses show the number of aces, by steps, just as over a Blackwood
4NT. 5♣ is used to ask for kings.

Ace Asking:

1NT — 4♣
   * 4♦: 0 or 3 aces
   * 4♥: 1 or 4 aces
   * 4♠: 2 aces, bad hand
   * 4NT: 2 aces, good hand

If the player using Gerber makes any bid other than 5♣, that is to play
(including 4NT).

King Asking:

1NT — 4♣ — any — 5♣ 
   * 5♦: 0 or 3 kings
   * 5♥: 1 or 4 kings
   * 5♠: 2 kings, bad hand
   * 5NT: 2 kings, bad hand
