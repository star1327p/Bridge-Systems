### Roman Key-Card Blackwood 0314
Once suit agreement has been reached, 4NT is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 
It can also be used to ask for "Queen or Extra Length" (queen = queen of trump, 
extra length = enough trump to promise 10 total).

4NT KC Asking:
   * 5♣: 0 or 3 keycards
   * 5♦: 1 or 4 keycards
   * 5♥: 2 keycards, no QOEL
   * 5♠: 2 keycards, QOEL

After a 5♣ or 5♦ response, the Blackwood initiator may ask for QOEL by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement)-4NT;5♣-5♦: Queen ask
      * 5♥: no QOEL
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦: QOEL, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT: QOEL, no kings

#### With (Useful) Voids
After 4NT, responder can show voids with at least one keycard:
   * 5NT: even number of keycards (never zero)
   * 6 of void suit: odd number of keycards
   * 6 of trump suit: odd number of keycards, void is in higher suit

#### 5NT
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and QOEL and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.
