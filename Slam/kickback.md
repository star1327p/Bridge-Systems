### Kickback Roman Key-Card 0314
Once suit agreement has been reached (or implied), one step over 4 of the trump suit is used to ask for keycards - 
the 4 aces and the king of trump. 

Kickback KC Asking:
   * 1 step: 0 or 3 keycards
   * 2 steps: 1 or 4 keycards
   * 3 steps: 2 keycards, no queen (of trump) or extra length (QoEL - promises a 10-card fit)
   * 4 steps: 2 keycards, QoEL

_do not show voids_

After a 1 or 2 step response, the Kickback initiator may ask for QoEL by bidding the next step:

   * (heart suit agreement) - 4♠; 5♣ - 5♦: Queen ask
      * 5♥: no QoEL
	  * 5♠, 6♣, 6♦: QoEL, that king, and no lower kings
	  * 5NT: QoEL, no kings

A bid of NT is to play, not a queen ask:
   * (diamond suit agreement) - 4♥; 4♠
      * 4NT: to play
      * 5♣: Q ask


#### 5NT (Specific Kings)
5NT guarantees the partnership holds all five keycards and is invitational to grand.
A 6-level bid shows the king in that suit.
