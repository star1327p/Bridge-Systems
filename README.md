This project contains system notes for bridge systems. 

Some examples: 

* http://jyutzler.github.io/Bridge-Systems/jeff-jenn.html
* http://jyutzler.github.io/Bridge-Systems/jeff-donna.html
* http://jyutzler.github.io/Bridge-Systems/jeff-rick.html



I do accept pull requests, if you are so inclined. 
If you want to add a new system, just create a new file. 
The pipeline handles the process of converting the AsciiDoc into HTML and publishing it on github.io.
