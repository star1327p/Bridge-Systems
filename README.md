This project contains system notes for bridge systems. 

Some examples: 

* http://jyutzler.github.io/Bridge-Systems/jeff-jenn.html
* http://jyutzler.github.io/Bridge-Systems/jeff-donna.html
* http://jyutzler.github.io/Bridge-Systems/jeff-rick.html

These systems are modularized. 
Most of the files in this repository are in the AsciiDoc format. 
The system files (in the root directory at this time) include the appropriate modules.
The pipeline handles the process of converting the AsciiDoc into HTML and publishing it on github.io.

I do accept pull requests, if you are so inclined. 
If you want to add a new system, just create a new file.
