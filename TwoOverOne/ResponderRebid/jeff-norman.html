<div class="paragraph">
<p>Responder promises to bid a second time unless unless opener’s rebid is at the game level,
since opener could have 18 points (just short of a jump shift rebid).
(This applies when responder is an unpassed hand.)
If responder bids a second time, it is either in support of opener or an attempt to find a NT contract.
A non-jump raise of opener’s first suit is invitational, usually with three-card support.</p>
