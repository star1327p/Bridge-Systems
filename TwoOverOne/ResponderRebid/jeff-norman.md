#### Responder's Rebids
Responder promises to bid a second time unless unless opener’s rebid is at the game level, 
since opener could have 18 points (just short of a jump shift rebid). 
(This applies when responder is an unpassed hand.)
If responder bids a second time, it is either in support of opener or an attempt to find a NT contract.
A non-jump raise of opener’s first suit is invitational, usually with three-card support.

1♠ — 2♣

   * 2♥ = game force, could be conventional.
   * 3♠ = game force with extras.
   * 4♠ = game, no extras.
