#### Responder's Rebids
Responder promises to bid a second time unless unless opener’s rebid is at the game level, 
since opener could have 18 points (just short of a jump shift rebid). 
(This applies when responder is an unpassed hand.)
If responder bids a second time, it is either in support of opener or an attempt to find a NT contract.
A subsequent jump raise of opener’s first suit to the THREE LEVEL is game 
forcing — responder should make a limit raise directly over the opening with 10–11 
points and at least three-card support:

1♠ — 2♣
2♦ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♦ = invitation to game (10–11 points).
    — 2♠ = preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a doubleton spade.
    — 2♥ = game force, could be conventional.
    — 3♠ = game force.

1♠ — 2♣
2♥ — 2NT, 3♣, 3♥ = invitation to game (10–11 points).
    — 2♠ = preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a doubleton spade.
    — 3♦ = game force, could be conventional.
    — 3♠ = game force.
