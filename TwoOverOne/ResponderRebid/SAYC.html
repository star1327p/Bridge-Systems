<div class="paragraph">
<p>Responder promises to bid a second time unless unless opener’s rebid is at the game level,
since opener could have 18 points (just short of a jump shift rebid).
(This applies when responder is an unpassed hand.)
If responder bids a second time, it is either in support of opener or an attempt to find a NT contract.
A subsequent jump raise of opener’s first suit to the THREE LEVEL is game
forcing — responder should make a limit raise directly over the opening with 10–11
points and at least three-card support:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>2♠: preference, not forcing. Responder has 11–12 points and a doubleton spade.</p>
