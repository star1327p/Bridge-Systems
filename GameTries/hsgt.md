#### Help Suit Game Try

Once any major suit is raised from 1 to 2 (declaring suit agreement), a new suit is a game try.
The idea is to identify a suit Qxx or better that would benefit from fitting honors. 
One may bid game, sign off, or make another game try.

When this treatment is used, other bids change their meanings.
   * 2NT shows a balanced hand
   * 3 of the trump suit shows bad trumps but otherwise a good hand
