#### Relay Game Try

Once any major suit is raised from 1 to 2 (declaring suit agreement), the cheapest bid is a generic game try.
The idea is to allow the presumptive dummy to set the contract 
or make a help suit game try.
* ...1M-2M
   * Cheapest bid: relay (game try)
   * 2NT over 2♥: 4+ spades, slam try
   * 3 other suit: 4+ cards, slam try
   * 3M: preemptive, no game interest
   * 3♠ over 2♥ or 4 other suit: splinter slam try

After the cheapest bid relay:
* 2NT: help suit game try in spades
* 3 other suit: help suit game try in that suit
* 3M: minimum
* 4M: maximum

After the game try, if the presumptive declarer is still undecided, 
he may relay to ask whether the game try is a minimum or maximum.
For example:
* 1♠-2♠;2NT-3♣;3♦

Note: this is similar to Richard Pavlicek's [system](http://rpbridge.net/7g70.htm).
