<div class="paragraph">
<p>A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality
and roughly 4â€“10 HCP, but flexible based on vulnerability and position.
On rare occasions it may be a very good five-card suit.
It is possible to open a weak two with a poor seven-card suit
(not good enough to open with at the three level)
but in MP scoring three level bids are pretty lenient.</p>
