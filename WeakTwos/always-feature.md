A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality 
and roughly 4â€“10 HCP, but flexible based on vulnerability and position. 
On rare occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. 
It is possible to open a weak two with a poor seven-card suit 
(not good enough to open with at the three level)
but in MP scoring three level bids are pretty lenient. 

Responses:
* New suit: forcing
   * Raise of responder's suit: honor-doubleton or better
   * Retreat: no outside strength
   * New suit: strength in that suit 
   * 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* 2NT: forcing, showing game interest (on in competition) 
   * New suit: feature (usually A or K in that suit)
   * Rebid of 3: no feature
   * 3NT: solid suit (AKJxxx or better)
* Any raise: to play, preemptive
* 3NT: to play (typically a good hand with three-card support)
