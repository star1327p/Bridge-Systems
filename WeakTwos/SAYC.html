<p>A weak two-bid shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. On rare
occasions it may be a very good five-card suit. It is possible to open a weak two with
a poor seven-card suit (not good enough to open with at the three level).</p>

<p>Responses:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 2NT response is forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) Opener rebids his suit with a
minimum weak two (5–8 points). With a maximum hand opener bids another
suit to show a “feature” (ace or king in that suit);
with a solid suit (AKJxxx or better) he raises to 3NT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Any raise of opener’s suit is to play and could be preemptive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 3NT response is also to play.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“RONF” on the card means “Raise Only Non-Force.” A new-suit response is forcing
one round and shows at least a five-card suit. Opener should raise a major suit
response with a three-card fit, or perhaps with a doubleton honor.</p>
