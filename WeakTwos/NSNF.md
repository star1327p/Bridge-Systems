A weak two-bid generally shows a six-card suit of reasonable quality and 5–11 HCP. 
A good five-card suit is possible, especially when non-vulnerable.
A poor seven-card suit is also possible when it is not good enough to open with at the three level. 

Responses:
   * 2NT: forcing, showing game interest. (This applies also if the
opponents intervene with a double or a bid.) 
   * Raise: to play, could be preemptive.
   * 3NT: to play.
   * New suit: non-forcing (alertable), showing a better preempt.

After a 2NT response,
   * Rebid original suit: weaker and/or longer suit
   * New suit: “feature” (ace or king in that suit)
   * 3NT: AKJ or better, no feature
